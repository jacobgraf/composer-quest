# Composer Quest: The Battle of the Packages

A browser-based game for Laracon 2025 Game Jam where you play as a Laravel "Composer" managing package dependencies!

## 🎮 Game Overview

**Objective**: Sort Laravel packages for 60 seconds! Accept valid packages (✅) and reject fake/malicious ones (❌) to achieve package harmony.

   - Keyboard: Left Arrow/A = Accept, Right Arrow/D = Reject
   - Mobile: Touch the buttons
4. **Special Events**: Watch for "DEPENDENCY CONFLICTS" - click RESOLVE quickly for bonus points!
