# System Patterns

This file documents recurring patterns and standards used in the project.
It is optional, but recommended to be updated as the project evolves.

## Coding Patterns

- **Game State Management**: Single game object with state properties (score, time, packages, etc.)
- **Event Handling**: Centralized event listeners with delegation for dynamic elements
- **Animation Pattern**: RequestAnimationFrame loop with delta time calculations
- **Audio Management**: Preloaded audio objects with fallback error handling
- **Package Generation**: Factory pattern for creating package objects with random properties

## Architectural Patterns

- **MVC-like Structure**: Separation of game logic, rendering, and user input handling
- **Component-based UI**: Reusable functions for creating game elements (buttons, scores, timers)
- **State Machine**: Clear game states (menu, playing, paused, game over)
- **Observer Pattern**: Event system for game state changes and score updates

## Testing Patterns

- **Manual Testing**: Cross-browser compatibility checks
- **Performance Testing**: Frame rate monitoring during gameplay
- **Responsive Testing**: Mobile and desktop layout verification
- **Audio Testing**: Sound effect timing and volume level validation
- **Accessibility Testing**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
