# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.
2025-07-29 12:08:41 - Initial decision log setup.

## Decision

Single-file architecture with embedded assets

## Rationale

- Laravel Cloud hosting compatibility requires minimal setup
- No build steps needed for deployment
- Easier distribution and testing
- All dependencies via CDN (Tailwind CSS)

## Implementation Details

- index.html contains all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Images embedded as base64 or stored in assets/ directory
- Audio files as local assets with fallback handling
- Tailwind CSS via CDN link

## Decision

Vanilla JavaScript for game logic

## Rationale

- No framework dependencies or build complexity
- Better performance for simple game mechanics
- Easier debugging and maintenance
- Meets game jam requirements

## Implementation Details

- Object-oriented approach for game state management
- Event-driven architecture for user interactions
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Local storage for high score persistence

## Decision

Switch to Code mode for implementation

## Rationale

Architect mode is restricted to Markdown files only, but the game development requires creating HTML, CSS, JavaScript files and saving image assets. Code mode has the necessary permissions to create and edit all file types needed for the project.

## Implementation Details

- Complete architectural planning in current mode
- Switch to Code mode for file creation and implementation
- Use Memory Bank to maintain context across mode transitions
- Return to Architect mode if additional planning is needed

[2025-07-29 12:09:38] - Mode restriction identified, planning transition to Code mode

## Decision

Corrected deployment strategy from Laravel Cloud to static hosting

## Rationale

The game is a pure static HTML/JavaScript application, not a Laravel application. While Laravel Cloud could technically host static files, it's designed for Laravel applications. Static hosting platforms are more appropriate and cost-effective for this type of project.

## Implementation Details

- Recommended GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or Surge.sh
- Updated README with proper deployment instructions
- Maintained Laravel Cloud compatibility note for game jam requirements
- No code changes needed - game remains deployment-ready

[2025-07-29 14:26:01] - Deployment strategy corrected based on user feedback

## Decision

Fixed package display overflow issue for long package names

## Rationale

Some package names (like "spatie/laravel-medialibrary" and "spatie/laravel-query-builder") were too long and breaking out of the 200px fixed-width package containers, causing visual overflow and poor user experience.

## Implementation Details

- Increased package container width from 200px to 250px
- Added `minHeight: "120px"` to ensure consistent container sizing
- Added `break-words` and `leading-tight` Tailwind classes to package name text
- Updated spawn positioning calculation to account for new 250px width
- Text now wraps properly within the container boundaries

[2025-07-29 20:37:45] - Package display overflow issue resolved

## Decision

Implemented proper image usage for conductor and package visuals

## Rationale

The game was using emoji characters (ðŸŽ¼ for conductor, ðŸ“¦ for packages) instead of the provided image assets. User uploaded conductor.jpg and packagist.jpg (both 800x800 JPEG images) that needed to be integrated into the game for better visual appeal and branding.

## Implementation Details

- Replaced conductor emoji with conductor.jpg image in 24x24px circular container
- Replaced package emoji with packagist.jpg image in 12x12px rounded container
- Added proper image styling with object-cover for aspect ratio preservation
- Used overflow-hidden for clean circular/rounded appearance
- Maintained existing layout structure and responsive design
- Images are properly sized and positioned within game elements

[2025-07-29 21:14:25] - Image assets properly integrated into game interface

## Decision

Refactored audio file names for better clarity and maintainability

## Rationale

The original audio file names (applause.mp3 and dissonant.mp3) were descriptive of the sound content but not intuitive for their game function. Using right.mp3 and wrong.mp3 makes the code more readable and the file purpose immediately clear to developers.

## Implementation Details

- Renamed applause.mp3 to right.mp3 (plays when player makes correct choice)
- Renamed dissonant.mp3 to wrong.mp3 (plays when player makes incorrect choice)
- Updated all code references in audio object initialization
- Updated audio.applause.play() calls to audio.right.play()
- Updated audio.dissonant.play() calls to audio.wrong.play()
- Maintained all existing audio functionality and volume settings

[2025-07-29 21:31:20] - Audio files renamed for better code clarity

## Decision

Fixed audio playback issues and implemented background music system

## Rationale

The right/wrong sound effects were not playing due to browser autoplay restrictions and lack of proper error handling. Additionally, the user requested background music functionality that plays during gameplay and stops when the game is inactive.

## Implementation Details

- **Enhanced Audio System**: Added robust error handling with try-catch blocks and Promise-based play() calls
- **Audio Helper Functions**: Created `playSound()` function that resets audio to start and handles play failures gracefully
- **Background Music**: Added `music.mp3` support with loop functionality
- **Music Control**: Implemented `startBackgroundMusic()` and `stopBackgroundMusic()` functions
- **Game State Integration**: Background music starts when game begins and stops when game ends
- **Volume Settings**: Set appropriate volumes (0.5 for effects, 0.2 for background music)
- **Browser Compatibility**: Added fallback handling for browsers that block autoplay

## Technical Changes

- Enhanced audio object with background music support
- Added currentTime reset for sound effects to ensure they play from start
- Implemented Promise-based audio play with error catching
- Integrated music start/stop with game state transitions
- Increased effect volumes from 0.3 to 0.5 for better audibility

[2025-07-29 21:35:00] - Audio system enhanced with background music and improved reliability
