# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.
2025-07-29 12:08:41 - Initial decision log setup.

## Decision

Single-file architecture with embedded assets

## Rationale

- Laravel Cloud hosting compatibility requires minimal setup
- No build steps needed for deployment
- Easier distribution and testing
- All dependencies via CDN (Tailwind CSS)

## Implementation Details

- index.html contains all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Images embedded as base64 or stored in assets/ directory
- Audio files as local assets with fallback handling
- Tailwind CSS via CDN link

## Decision

Vanilla JavaScript for game logic

## Rationale

- No framework dependencies or build complexity
- Better performance for simple game mechanics
- Easier debugging and maintenance
- Meets game jam requirements

## Implementation Details

- Object-oriented approach for game state management
- Event-driven architecture for user interactions
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Local storage for high score persistence

## Decision

Switch to Code mode for implementation

## Rationale

Architect mode is restricted to Markdown files only, but the game development requires creating HTML, CSS, JavaScript files and saving image assets. Code mode has the necessary permissions to create and edit all file types needed for the project.

## Implementation Details

- Complete architectural planning in current mode
- Switch to Code mode for file creation and implementation
- Use Memory Bank to maintain context across mode transitions
- Return to Architect mode if additional planning is needed

[2025-07-29 12:09:38] - Mode restriction identified, planning transition to Code mode

## Decision

Corrected deployment strategy from Laravel Cloud to static hosting

## Rationale

The game is a pure static HTML/JavaScript application, not a Laravel application. While Laravel Cloud could technically host static files, it's designed for Laravel applications. Static hosting platforms are more appropriate and cost-effective for this type of project.

## Implementation Details

- Recommended GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or Surge.sh
- Updated README with proper deployment instructions
- Maintained Laravel Cloud compatibility note for game jam requirements
- No code changes needed - game remains deployment-ready
